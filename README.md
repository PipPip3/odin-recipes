Odin Recipes Project

This four page website contains a small collection of recipes that chefs may have to tackle to prove their cooking skills in a practical job interview. Foundational Git and HTML skills were used to build the site. These skills include:
- Using Git workflow to manage the project
- Displaying content with various elements and tags
- Using the HTML boilerplate to ensure correct page structure
- Adding both ordered and unordered lists
- Adding links and images
